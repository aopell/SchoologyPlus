# Privacy Policy - Schoology Plus

## Introduction

**Updated 5/26/2020**

It is Schoology Plus's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while using our website or operating our browser extension. This Privacy Policy applies to the Schoology Plus website and browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "Schoology Plus"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information accessible to us through usage of Schoology Plus. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected by our Extension, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the website and browser extension and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.

## Non Personally Identifying Information

Like most website operators, Schoology Plus collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each user request. Schoology Plus's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Schoology Plus's users use the website and extension. From time to time, Schoology Plus may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the website and/or the extension.

Schoology Plus uses Google Analytics to collect information for these purposes. If you would like to opt-out of tracking on our website, you can install the [Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en) or another tracking-prevention extension. If you would like to opt-out of tracking in our extension, you can change the "Anonymous Usage Statistics" setting to "Disabled" in Schoology Plus settings.

## Personally Identifying Information

By using Schoology Plus, you grant us access to view and modify the contents of the Schoology website in your web browser. However, we DO NOT harvest or collect any information that can personally identify you longer than absolutely necessary to perform calculations or page enhancements. This information (including, but not limited to, name, grades, and assignment details) is only modified locally and never leaves your computer. 

## Aggregated Statistics

Schoology Plus may collect statistics about the behavior of users. Schoology Plus may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Schoology Plus does not disclose your personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

To enrich and perfect your online experience, Schoology Plus uses "Cookies" and similar technologies and services provided by others to display personalized content and store your preferences on your computer. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer, and that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user returns. Schoology Plus uses cookies to help us identify and track users' extension preferences. Schoology Plus users who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Schoology Plus, with the drawback that certain features of Schoology Plus may not function properly without the aid of cookies. By continuing to use Schoology Plus without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to Schoology Plus's use of cookies.

Schoology Plus encourages users to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of Schoology Plus after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change. Any major changes will be prominently announced.
